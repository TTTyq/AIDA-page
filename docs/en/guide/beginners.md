## Environment Setup

### Installing Basic Tools

Before we start development, we need to install some basic tools. Don't worry, we'll guide you through this process step by step!

### Installing Cursor Editor

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that helps you write code more efficiently. This is the first tool we'll install because once you have Cursor, you can use its AI assistant to help you install and configure all the other tools!

1. Visit the [Cursor website](https://cursor.sh/)
2. Download the version suitable for your operating system
3. Install and launch Cursor
4. Register or log in to your Cursor account
   - **Important note**: In the AIDA project, we use the team shared account `work@thevertexlab.com` (ask for the password in the team chat)
   - Using the team account allows sharing subscription benefits and quotas, which is a team perk

::: info Relationship Between Cursor and VSCode
Cursor is actually an enhanced editor built on VSCode. It retains all the excellent features of VSCode (such as the extension system, debugging tools, Git integration, etc.) while integrating powerful AI capabilities. This means:
- If you're familiar with VSCode, you'll immediately be familiar with Cursor's interface and basic operations
- You can use most VSCode extensions
- All VSCode keyboard shortcuts work in Cursor
- But Cursor additionally provides powerful AI code generation, code explanation, automatic refactoring, and other features

You can think of Cursor as a combination of VSCode + AI assistant, giving you powerful AI support in a familiar environment!
:::

::: warning ðŸŽ‰ New Era of Programming!
After completing this step, you can say goodbye to cold code and complicated command lines! You only need to remember a few commands, and most of the time you just need to use natural language to talk to AI to complete programming tasks. Imagine just saying "help me implement a login page," and AI generates the code for you! Isn't that super cool?! This is the revolutionary change brought by AI-assisted programming!
:::

### Cursor Usage Tips

Before you start using Cursor for development, here are some important usage tips:

1. **Open the AI chat interface**:
   - Use the shortcut `Cmd+L` (macOS) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows) to open the chat interface at the bottom
   - Or click the chat icon in the bottom right corner of the editor

2. **Switch to Agent mode**:
   - In the chat interface, click the dropdown menu in the top right corner and select "Agent" mode
   - In Agent mode, AI can automatically perform multiple operations, such as searching code, reading files, editing code, etc.
   - Note: Agent mode will automatically stop after executing a maximum of 25 commands to prevent infinite loops

::: warning Mode Selection Alert
Make sure you've correctly switched to Agent mode! If you notice the AI is only answering questions but not performing any actions (like reading files, modifying code, etc.), it's likely because you're still in Ask mode. Most development tasks should be done in Agent mode unless you're just asking a simple question. Get in the habit of checking your mode every time you start a new conversation.
:::

3. **About command execution**:
   - When AI suggests executing command line commands, it will display a "Run Command" button
   - You need to manually click this button to execute the command; AI will not automatically execute command line operations

4. **Handling code application issues**:
   - Sometimes AI-generated code changes may not be automatically applied to files
   - If you see AI outputting code in the dialog box instead of directly modifying the file, look for and click the "Apply" button
   - If there's no "Apply" button, you can manually copy the code and paste it into the appropriate file

::: info ðŸ’¡ Tip
If AI seems stuck or behaving abnormally, try refreshing the page or restarting Cursor. Sometimes a simple restart can solve most problems!
:::

::: warning Important Note
Please note that during the Cursor installation process, you don't have an AI assistant to ask questions yet. But once you've installed and logged in successfully, you can use Cursor's AI assistant to help you install and configure all subsequent tools! That's why we put installing Cursor as the first step.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the frontend, backend, and documentation services simultaneously. You'll see a nice output displaying the access addresses for all services.

::: info ðŸš€ Achievement Moment!
Feeling a bit excited when you see all services successfully starting? This is a full-stack application that you've set up yourself! Although you just ran a simple command, you've successfully started a complete project with frontend, backend, and database. This used to require professional developers spending a lot of time to accomplish!
:::

### Accessing Various Services

After successful startup, you can access the various services through the following addresses:

- **Frontend application**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend service**: http://localhost:8000
- **Project documentation**: http://localhost:5173
- **API documentation**: http://localhost:8000/api/docs

### Understanding the Project Structure

Now that you've successfully run the project, let's understand the basic structure of the project.

### Project Directory Structure

- `frontend/`: Frontend code, using the Next.js framework
- `backend/`: Backend code, using the FastAPI framework
- `docs/`: Project documentation, using VitePress

Backend APIs can be understood as a set of functions that are called through HTTP requests. For example:

- When you visit `http://localhost:8000/api/artists`, the backend will return a list of all artists
- When you visit `http://localhost:8000/api/artists/123`, the backend will return information about the artist with ID 123

You can view all available API endpoints and their detailed descriptions by visiting the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`.

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

In the AIDA project, we use Git for version control. Here's the basic Git workflow:

### Using GPT Memory

The AIDA project uses the GPT Memory system to help AI assistants (like the AI in Cursor) understand project context and standards.

### Understanding GPT Memory Files

The `gptmemory/` directory in the project contains the following important files:

- `project_memo.md`: Project standards, context, and common pitfalls
- `working_memory_[username].md`: Working memory for each developer

### First-time Using AI Assistant

When you first use the AI assistant in Cursor, you should have it read these files so it can understand the project's standards and context. Open a file in Cursor, then type in the chat box at the bottom:

```
Please read gptmemory/project_memo.md to understand project standards and context
```

### Creating Personal Working Memory

You don't need to manually create a working memory file; you can let the AI assistant help you create one:

1. In Cursor's chat box, type:
   ```
   Please refer to @working_memory_dim.md and help me create a working_memory_[your name].md
   ```

2. The AI assistant will help you create a new working memory file and set it up based on Dim's working memory format

::: tip Let AI Help You
After creating a working memory file, you can ask the AI assistant to help you update it:

> Please help me update my working memory file, adding the task I'm working on: implementing pagination for the artist list page.

AI will help you edit the working memory file, adding the new task and maintaining consistent formatting.
:::

3. When you start a new task, at the beginning of each conversation, you should reference your working memory file:
   ```
   @working_memory_[your name].md I'm starting a new task, [describe your task]
   ```
