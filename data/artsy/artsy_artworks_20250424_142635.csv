This lighting technique, reminiscent of the chiaroscuro method, creates a sultry effect throughout Franco Klein’s work exploring themes like consumption, leisure, emotional disconnection, media overstimulation, and the notion of eternal youth. Franco Klein began taking photos while studying architecture in Mexico City; she later received her MA in Photography from the University of the Arts London. The artist has received international acclaim throughout her career and her work has been exhibited in fairs including Photo Basel and Photo London. Often featuring imagery and environments associated with domesticity and suburbia, Klein’s images also reflect her interest in the iconography of “the American Dream,” especially in the Western world.

The artist has received international acclaim throughout her career and her work has been exhibited in fairs including Photo Basel and Photo London. Often featuring imagery and environments associated with domesticity and suburbia, Klein’s images also reflect her interest in the iconography of “the American Dream,” especially in the Western world.

This lighting technique, reminiscent of the chiaroscuro method, creates a sultry effect throughout Franco Klein’s work exploring themes like consumption, leisure, emotional disconnection, media overstimulation, and the notion of eternal youth. Franco Klein began taking photos while studying architecture in Mexico City; she later received her MA in Photography from the University of the Arts London. The artist has received international acclaim throughout her career and her work has been exhibited in fairs including Photo Basel and Photo London. Often featuring imagery and environments associated with domesticity and suburbia, Klein’s images also reflect her interest in the iconography of “the American Dream,” especially in the Western world.

The artist drew on a wide array of influences, ranging from the bold brushwork of Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline to Dada cut-ups and scientific illustration. His mark-making hovered between associative notation and romantic symbolism. Twombly’s works have been shown in cities across the world, and they belong to the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Centre Pompidou, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Guggenheim, among many others. His work has fetched prices in the tens of millions on the secondary market. In addition to his paintings, Twombly produced multimedia sculptures and collages and maintained a consistent photography practice.

Across her lush canvases, she developed her signature soak-stain technique, in which she applied washes of thinned paint to unprimed canvas. This strategy created vivid, apparently flowing blocks of color and exerted a strong influence on color field painters such as Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. During her lifetime, Frankenthaler showed extensively in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Chicago, and London, among others. Her work belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In addition to her paintings, Frankenthaler also made ceramics and steel sculptures and maintained an extensive printmaking practice.

Across her lush canvases, she developed her signature soak-stain technique, in which she applied washes of thinned paint to unprimed canvas. This strategy created vivid, apparently flowing blocks of color and exerted a strong influence on color field painters such as Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. During her lifetime, Frankenthaler showed extensively in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Chicago, and London, among others. Her work belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In addition to her paintings, Frankenthaler also made ceramics and steel sculptures and maintained an extensive printmaking practice.
