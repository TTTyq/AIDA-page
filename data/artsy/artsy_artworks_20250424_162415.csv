This lighting technique, reminiscent of the chiaroscuro method, creates a sultry effect throughout Franco Klein’s work exploring themes like consumption, leisure, emotional disconnection, media overstimulation, and the notion of eternal youth. Franco Klein began taking photos while studying architecture in Mexico City; she later received her MA in Photography from the University of the Arts London. The artist has received international acclaim throughout her career and her work has been exhibited in fairs including Photo Basel and Photo London. Often featuring imagery and environments associated with domesticity and suburbia, Klein’s images also reflect her interest in the iconography of “the American Dream,” especially in the Western world.

This lighting technique, reminiscent of the chiaroscuro method, creates a sultry effect throughout Franco Klein’s work exploring themes like consumption, leisure, emotional disconnection, media overstimulation, and the notion of eternal youth. Franco Klein began taking photos while studying architecture in Mexico City; she later received her MA in Photography from the University of the Arts London. The artist has received international acclaim throughout her career and her work has been exhibited in fairs including Photo Basel and Photo London. Often featuring imagery and environments associated with domesticity and suburbia, Klein’s images also reflect her interest in the iconography of “the American Dream,” especially in the Western world.

The artist drew on a wide array of influences, ranging from the bold brushwork of Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline to Dada cut-ups and scientific illustration. His mark-making hovered between associative notation and romantic symbolism. Twombly’s works have been shown in cities across the world, and they belong to the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Centre Pompidou, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Guggenheim, among many others. His work has fetched prices in the tens of millions on the secondary market. In addition to his paintings, Twombly produced multimedia sculptures and collages and maintained a consistent photography practice.

Across her lush canvases, she developed her signature soak-stain technique, in which she applied washes of thinned paint to unprimed canvas. This strategy created vivid, apparently flowing blocks of color and exerted a strong influence on color field painters such as Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. During her lifetime, Frankenthaler showed extensively in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Chicago, and London, among others. Her work belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In addition to her paintings, Frankenthaler also made ceramics and steel sculptures and maintained an extensive printmaking practice.

Across her lush canvases, she developed her signature soak-stain technique, in which she applied washes of thinned paint to unprimed canvas. This strategy created vivid, apparently flowing blocks of color and exerted a strong influence on color field painters such as Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. During her lifetime, Frankenthaler showed extensively in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Chicago, and London, among others. Her work belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In addition to her paintings, Frankenthaler also made ceramics and steel sculptures and maintained an extensive printmaking practice.

Filled with biomorphic and geologic shapes, his paintings are documents of emotional responses to the light, mood, and color of certain exotic landscapes and experiences. Stamos was influenced by colleagues such as Mark Rothko, merging spirituality with a color layering technique that was an early precursor to the Color Field Painting movement. A lifelong traveler and student of Hellenistic culture, his paintings often reference ancient belief systems.

His paintings evince influences from his childhood in India, surrounded by vivid textiles, practicing rangoli, and witnessing the Holi Festival, and adulthood in New York in the 1960s and ’70s, in a milieu that included Andy Warhol, Merce Cunningham, and fellow Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko. To make his paintings, which range from intimate to grand, Bhavsar sifts powdered pigments onto canvas, allowing air currents and his own breath and body movements to determine where they fall, creating smoky, layered compositions. “I think I have tried to convey how to free oneself,” he describes. “Using color as a force to reach towards the beauty and generosity of the material that allows you unlimited expression.”

His paintings evince influences from his childhood in India, surrounded by vivid textiles, practicing rangoli, and witnessing the Holi Festival, and adulthood in New York in the 1960s and ’70s, in a milieu that included Andy Warhol, Merce Cunningham, and fellow Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko. To make his paintings, which range from intimate to grand, Bhavsar sifts powdered pigments onto canvas, allowing air currents and his own breath and body movements to determine where they fall, creating smoky, layered compositions. “I think I have tried to convey how to free oneself,” he describes. “Using color as a force to reach towards the beauty and generosity of the material that allows you unlimited expression.”

He briefly worked in a Cubist mode and helped spur movements including Dada and Conceptualism. Though his practice spanned drawing, painting, and installation, Duchamp is perhaps most famous for his “readymade” sculptures: pieces composed of prefabricated objects such as a urinal, a shovel, or a bicycle wheel affixed to a wooden stool, which the artist situated in the middle of the exhibition space. Duchamp saw the readymade as an opportunity to free art from traditional confines of taste and beauty. He studied at Académie Julian before becoming involved in the avant-garde circles of New York and Paris. Duchamp also played tournament chess and, in the last decades of his life, worked in secret on a final installation, Étant donnés (1946–66). His pieces have sold for up to eight figures on the secondary market and belong in the collections of countless institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, the Staatliches Museum Schwerin, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Dalí’s fantastical prints, paintings, sculptures, films, and writing helped cement the movement’s identity. Working off psychoanalytic ideas, Dalí rendered fantastical creatures and landscapes that could unsettle and awe. His 1931 canvas The Persistence of Memory is one of the most recognizable artworks of all time. Dalí exhibited widely in his lifetime, and his works belong in the collections of institutions including the Tate, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago, among others. His work has fetched multimillions of dollars on the secondary market.

Born Emmanuel Radnitzky, the artist adopted his pseudonym in 1909 and—while he also worked across painting, sculpture, video, and printmaking—became renowned for his striking, sensual black-and-white photographs. A number of his portraits—such as Larmes (Tears) (ca. 1932), which features a woman “crying” glass bead tears, and his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse—are icons of 20th-century art. Man Ray also embraced technical experimentation; he used solarization and made Rayographs (an eponym for his photograms) as he pushed the boundaries of avant-garde photography. At auction, his work has sold for seven figures, and his paintings have fetched particularly high prices.

Inspired by African and Iberian art, he also contributed to the rise of Surrealism and Expressionism. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre grew to include over 20,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures,ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs. He painted his most famous work, Guernica (1937), in response to the Spanish Civil War; the totemic grisaille canvas remains a definitive work of anti-war art. At auction, a number of Picasso’s paintings have sold for more than $100 million. The indefatigable artist has been the subject of exhibitions at the world’s most prestigious institutions, from the Museum of Modern Art and Centre Pompidou to the Stedelijk Museum and Tate Modern.Perhaps the most influential artist of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso may be best known for pioneering Cubism and fracturing the two-dimensional picture plane in order to convey three-dimensional space.

RHRichard HamiltonBritish, 1922–2011FollowingFollowIn his celebrated collages that set the stage for Pop art, Richard Hamilton explored the relationship between fine art, product design, and popular culture. Hamilton’s style is exemplified in his most famous work, Just What Is It that Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealing? (1956), which features a mélange of disparate images cut out from magazines. The result is a strange, domestic interior scene featuring a nude couple rendered in grayscale. When the Whitechapel Gallery included the piece in its seminal “This Is Tomorrow” exhibition in 1956, it was met with acclaim and helped spur the development of Pop art. Hamilton’s work has been exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Cologne, Seoul, and Los Angeles and belongs in the collections of the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Tate, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. His pieces have sold for six figures on the secondary market.

Hamilton’s style is exemplified in his most famous work, Just What Is It that Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealing? (1956), which features a mélange of disparate images cut out from magazines. The result is a strange, domestic interior scene featuring a nude couple rendered in grayscale. When the Whitechapel Gallery included the piece in its seminal “This Is Tomorrow” exhibition in 1956, it was met with acclaim and helped spur the development of Pop art. Hamilton’s work has been exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Cologne, Seoul, and Los Angeles and belongs in the collections of the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Tate, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. His pieces have sold for six figures on the secondary market.

Hamilton’s style is exemplified in his most famous work, Just What Is It that Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealing? (1956), which features a mélange of disparate images cut out from magazines. The result is a strange, domestic interior scene featuring a nude couple rendered in grayscale. When the Whitechapel Gallery included the piece in its seminal “This Is Tomorrow” exhibition in 1956, it was met with acclaim and helped spur the development of Pop art. Hamilton’s work has been exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Cologne, Seoul, and Los Angeles and belongs in the collections of the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Tate, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. His pieces have sold for six figures on the secondary market.

MaterialsLithograph in colorsSize25 1/4 × 28 in | 64.1 × 71.1 cmMediumPrintCOClaes OldenburgSwedish, 1929–2022FollowingFollowSince the 1960s, Claes Oldenburg has worked at the forefront of the Conceptual and Pop art movements, and he’s best known for his monumental public sculptures of everyday objects. These include Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks (1969, reworked 1974) in New Haven, Connecticut; Clothespin (1976) in Philadelphia; Shuttlecocks (1992) in Kansas City; and Cupid’s Span (2002), a gigantic archer’s bow in San Francisco. These pieces epitomize Oldenburg’s irreverent sense of humor and fascination with American consumerism, qualities which have also pervaded his performances, drawings, writings, and famous “soft sculptures”—cushiony, unserious objects that resemble diner foods and other symbols of Americana. Oldenburg’s work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Moderna Museet, and the Centre Pompidou. At auction, many of his sculptures—including those of a clothespin, a depiction of a flexed muscle, french horns, a dress, a trowel, a sewing machine, and a typewriter eraser—have sold for more than $1 million. Oldenburg often collaborated with his late wife, Coosje van Bruggen, who died in 2009.

These include Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks (1969, reworked 1974) in New Haven, Connecticut; Clothespin (1976) in Philadelphia; Shuttlecocks (1992) in Kansas City; and Cupid’s Span (2002), a gigantic archer’s bow in San Francisco. These pieces epitomize Oldenburg’s irreverent sense of humor and fascination with American consumerism, qualities which have also pervaded his performances, drawings, writings, and famous “soft sculptures”—cushiony, unserious objects that resemble diner foods and other symbols of Americana. Oldenburg’s work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Moderna Museet, and the Centre Pompidou. At auction, many of his sculptures—including those of a clothespin, a depiction of a flexed muscle, french horns, a dress, a trowel, a sewing machine, and a typewriter eraser—have sold for more than $1 million. Oldenburg often collaborated with his late wife, Coosje van Bruggen, who died in 2009.

These include Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks (1969, reworked 1974) in New Haven, Connecticut; Clothespin (1976) in Philadelphia; Shuttlecocks (1992) in Kansas City; and Cupid’s Span (2002), a gigantic archer’s bow in San Francisco. These pieces epitomize Oldenburg’s irreverent sense of humor and fascination with American consumerism, qualities which have also pervaded his performances, drawings, writings, and famous “soft sculptures”—cushiony, unserious objects that resemble diner foods and other symbols of Americana. Oldenburg’s work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Moderna Museet, and the Centre Pompidou. At auction, many of his sculptures—including those of a clothespin, a depiction of a flexed muscle, french horns, a dress, a trowel, a sewing machine, and a typewriter eraser—have sold for more than $1 million. Oldenburg often collaborated with his late wife, Coosje van Bruggen, who died in 2009.

She emerged in the 1970s, a student of Robert Irwin’s. In her early works, she marked the California desert with colored pigment, mapping both the earthly and celestial terrain, a practice she has since brought to sites worldwide. Among her best-known projects is Sol Star (1996), for which she marked the desert south of the Great Pyramids of Giza with blue circles, each one associated with a star. Albuquerque’s work is centered upon scale, and our smallness in an infinite cosmos. “I was interested in that impossibility of vision,” she explains, “being able to perceive only what is around us, yet aware that […] what we are perceiving is only part of a much larger vision.”

Among her best-known projects is Sol Star (1996), for which she marked the desert south of the Great Pyramids of Giza with blue circles, each one associated with a star. Albuquerque’s work is centered upon scale, and our smallness in an infinite cosmos. “I was interested in that impossibility of vision,” she explains, “being able to perceive only what is around us, yet aware that […] what we are perceiving is only part of a much larger vision.”

Chicago’s practice spans painting, textile arts, sculpture, and installation and has explored the intricacies of childbirth (as seen in her “Birth Project” series, 1980–85), the possibilities of minimalist sculpture, and the relationship between landscape and the female body. Her most famous work, an installation called The Dinner Party (1974–79), is an homage to 39 influential female figures from Eastern and Western mythology and civilization.

Dalí’s fantastical prints, paintings, sculptures, films, and writing helped cement the movement’s identity. Working off psychoanalytic ideas, Dalí rendered fantastical creatures and landscapes that could unsettle and awe. His 1931 canvas The Persistence of Memory is one of the most recognizable artworks of all time. Dalí exhibited widely in his lifetime, and his works belong in the collections of institutions including the Tate, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago, among others.

Dalí’s fantastical prints, paintings, sculptures, films, and writing helped cement the movement’s identity. Working off psychoanalytic ideas, Dalí rendered fantastical creatures and landscapes that could unsettle and awe. His 1931 canvas The Persistence of Memory is one of the most recognizable artworks of all time. Dalí exhibited widely in his lifetime, and his works belong in the collections of institutions including the Tate, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago, among others.

Drawing on the work of photographers including William Eggleston and Diane Arbus and the fantastical films of Steven Spielberg and David Lynch, Crewdson plans out his large-format frames with meticulous detail; the photographer often employs large crews and film equipment to ensure that the final images evoke significant narrative and atmosphere. Crewdson studied at SUNY Purchase before receiving an MFA in photography from Yale.

Drawing on the work of photographers including William Eggleston and Diane Arbus and the fantastical films of Steven Spielberg and David Lynch, Crewdson plans out his large-format frames with meticulous detail; the photographer often employs large crews and film equipment to ensure that the final images evoke significant narrative and atmosphere. Crewdson studied at SUNY Purchase before receiving an MFA in photography from Yale. His work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others.

Ventrone’s paintings still frequently feature nudes, as well as carefully arranged still lifes. For each of his works, Ventrone carefully stages his subject under bright studio lights, and photographs the arrangement for painting reference.

The style and concerns of her early works placed them in dialogue with those of the Minimalists; though diverging from the Minimalists in her exploration of three-dimensional space in painting, rather than flat surfaces, her images of diffuse light on wooden ground and rulers lying on a linoleum floor occupy a space between representation and abstraction. From the early 1980s, Mangold began to paint sensitive landscape images that she sometimes framed by what appears to be masking tape adhered to the picture plane, but upon closer inspection is Mangold’s illusionistic painting of tape. She also focused her eye on individual trees, returning to the same subjects repeatedly for decades—tightly cropped compositions of individual elm, maple, locust, and pink oak trees depicted from unusual vantage points.

The style and concerns of her early works placed them in dialogue with those of the Minimalists; though diverging from the Minimalists in her exploration of three-dimensional space in painting, rather than flat surfaces, her images of diffuse light on wooden ground and rulers lying on a linoleum floor occupy a space between representation and abstraction. From the early 1980s, Mangold began to paint sensitive landscape images that she sometimes framed by what appears to be masking tape adhered to the picture plane, but upon closer inspection is Mangold’s illusionistic painting of tape. She also focused her eye on individual trees, returning to the same subjects repeatedly for decades—tightly cropped compositions of individual elm, maple, locust, and pink oak trees depicted from unusual vantage points.

Born in Baltimore, Maryland, she spent most of her adult life in Washington D.C., where she began creating tall, freestanding wooden sculptures that became her signature style in the 1960s. Truitt’s sculptures, sleekly fabricated and painted with multiple colors, aim to evoke a sense of presence grounded in her experiences through their simplicity and subtle variations. Associated with the Minimalist art movement, Truitt’s works have been exhibited in prestigious institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the The Hirshhorn Museum. She is also the author of several books, based on her journals, describing her life as an artist.

Born in Baltimore, Maryland, she spent most of her adult life in Washington D.C., where she began creating tall, freestanding wooden sculptures that became her signature style in the 1960s. Truitt’s sculptures, sleekly fabricated and painted with multiple colors, aim to evoke a sense of presence grounded in her experiences through their simplicity and subtle variations. Associated with the Minimalist art movement, Truitt’s works have been exhibited in prestigious institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the The Hirshhorn Museum. She is also the author of several books, based on her journals, describing her life as an artist.

His works often feature shaped canvases, bold blocks of color, and simple patterns of chevrons, stripes, and bull’s-eyes. Noland pushed American abstract painting beyond the boundaries of Abstract Expressionism—instead of focusing on gestures and energetic lines, he conducted more conceptual experiments with color, form, and pared-back compositions that espoused flatness and a minimalist sensibility. Noland’s work has been exhibited in New York, Paris, Los Angeles, London, Tokyo, Berlin, and Zürich and belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. Noland’s paintings have sold for up to seven figures at auction.

Throughout the post-war period, he made radical shifts away from the dominant forms and disciplines of his day. For example, Caro eliminated plinths from his practice and placed his sculptures directly on the floor. He constructed his large-scale pieces from materials such as rope, wood, lead, and—most famously—rusted steel. On occasion, he used found objects including buoys, chains, and railroad ties. Caro’s work often blurred the lines between architecture and art. The artist was enormously influential, and his work has been exhibited at institutions including Tate Britain, the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Seoul Museum of Art, the National Gallery in London, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. Caro’s sculptures have fetched seven figures on the secondary market.

MaterialsArchival pigment print mounted on DibondSize60 × 40 in | 152.4 × 101.6 cmMediumPrintJRJon RafmanCanadian, b. 1981FollowingFollowDigital artist Jon Rafman is best known for his work around Google Street View, which he approaches as a repository of images that bring to the fore the relationship between technology and human experience. Concerned with the tension between the camera’s indifference and the human search for meaning, he has said, “While celebrating and critiquing modern experience, the technological tools themselves show how they can estrange us from ourselves.” For his ongoing project, Brand New Paint Job, Rafman appropriates elements from modernist paintings—by Joan Miró, Yves Klein, and Jackson Pollock, among others—using them as textures that he applies to digital renderings of 3D models, including busts, interior spaces, cars, and pieces of furniture.

Concerned with the tension between the camera’s indifference and the human search for meaning, he has said, “While celebrating and critiquing modern experience, the technological tools themselves show how they can estrange us from ourselves.” For his ongoing project, Brand New Paint Job, Rafman appropriates elements from modernist paintings—by Joan Miró, Yves Klein, and Jackson Pollock, among others—using them as textures that he applies to digital renderings of 3D models, including busts, interior spaces, cars, and pieces of furniture.

Prior to joining the Gutai, Uemae had studied Nan Ga—the southern school of Chinese painting—and western movements, but believes his most formative experience was an apprenticeship in Kyozome, or the Kyoto style of dyeing. Because of this training, as well as a childhood immersed in non-figurative design, the practice of sewing became paramount to Uemae’s mature style. His mixed-media paintings sometimes feature textile elements, but are characteristically identified by his careful compositions comprised of fine dots or patterns. He remains active in his 90s, still producing etchings and silkscreens.

Prior to joining the Gutai, Uemae had studied Nan Ga—the southern school of Chinese painting—and western movements, but believes his most formative experience was an apprenticeship in Kyozome, or the Kyoto style of dyeing. Because of this training, as well as a childhood immersed in non-figurative design, the practice of sewing became paramount to Uemae’s mature style. His mixed-media paintings sometimes feature textile elements, but are characteristically identified by his careful compositions comprised of fine dots or patterns.

Prior to joining the Gutai, Uemae had studied Nan Ga—the southern school of Chinese painting—and western movements, but believes his most formative experience was an apprenticeship in Kyozome, or the Kyoto style of dyeing. Because of this training, as well as a childhood immersed in non-figurative design, the practice of sewing became paramount to Uemae’s mature style. His mixed-media paintings sometimes feature textile elements, but are characteristically identified by his careful compositions comprised of fine dots or patterns. He remains active in his 90s, still producing etchings and silkscreens.

Inspired by Yoshihara’s mandate “Do what has never been done before,” the Gutai artists created original artworks that emphasized gesture and physicality. Yoshihara’s work has been exhibited throughout his native Japan and at museums around the world, including MoMA and the Guggenheim. Mostly self-taught, Yoshihara began producing surrealist works in the 1920s and ’30s and later developed a style of action painting inspired by Japanese calligraphy and Zen philosophy as well as Western abstraction. Starting in the 1960s, he produced myriad variations on the circle, whose simplicity and ubiquity he believed provided infinite possibilities for artistic expression.

F"" Atsuko Tanaka' on the reverseATAtsuko TanakaJapanese, 1932–2005FollowingFollowAtsuko Tanaka was known best for her experimental clothing and performances. She made her early paintings by using commercially purchased cloth stretched into canvases. After she joined the Gutai Art Group in 1955, Tanaka became influenced by the group’s preoccupations with chance, time, and space. During that time, Tanaka came to see her body as a malleable artwork, and her entire oeuvre as a form of painting. In one of her best-known works, Electric Dress (1956), she wore and moved around in a garment made from incandescent light bulbs. Other performances involved changing outfits that emphasized constraint or transformation, presented everyday objects for aesthetic consideration, and made engravings on sand.

Other performances involved changing outfits that emphasized constraint or transformation, presented everyday objects for aesthetic consideration, and made engravings on sand.

MaterialsMixed media with Korean paper on canvasSize31 7/10 × 39 2/5 in | 80.5 × 100 cmMediumMixed MediaSignatureSigned on the reverse; titled and dated on the reversePSPark Seo-BoKorean, 1931–2023FollowingFollowPark Seo-bo’s predominantly monochrome experiments with linear abstraction helped define Dansaekhwa, an essential movement within Korean modernism. Park is perhaps best known for his “Ecriture” series, which exemplifies the artist’s focus on material and process; in order to create precise, cumulative canvases, he penciled marks into still-wet painted surfaces, then layered Korean hanji paper overtop. Park graduated from Seoul’s Hongik University in 1954, when South Korea was still reeling from military conflict with North Korea. He has exhibited widely over the years, in galleries from Seoul and Busan to Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Beijing. His work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, and the Seoul Museum of Art, among many other institutions. His precise, minimalist practice filters Western notions of abstraction through the lenses of Korean calligraphy and Buddhist and Taoist philosophy.

Park is perhaps best known for his “Ecriture” series, which exemplifies the artist’s focus on material and process; in order to create precise, cumulative canvases, he penciled marks into still-wet painted surfaces, then layered Korean hanji paper overtop. Park graduated from Seoul’s Hongik University in 1954, when South Korea was still reeling from military conflict with North Korea. He has exhibited widely over the years, in galleries from Seoul and Busan to Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Beijing. His work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, and the Seoul Museum of Art, among many other institutions. His precise, minimalist practice filters Western notions of abstraction through the lenses of Korean calligraphy and Buddhist and Taoist philosophy.

Park is perhaps best known for his “Ecriture” series, which exemplifies the artist’s focus on material and process; in order to create precise, cumulative canvases, he penciled marks into still-wet painted surfaces, then layered Korean hanji paper overtop. Park graduated from Seoul’s Hongik University in 1954, when South Korea was still reeling from military conflict with North Korea. He has exhibited widely over the years, in galleries from Seoul and Busan to Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Beijing. His work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, and the Seoul Museum of Art, among many other institutions. His precise, minimalist practice filters Western notions of abstraction through the lenses of Korean calligraphy and Buddhist and Taoist philosophy.

Yun began to develop his visually stark, technically complex style in the early 1970s; he was particularly inspired by Mark Rothko’s color field paintings, which he saw on a 1974 trip to New York. He rose to prominence in Korea and represented his country at the 1995 Venice Biennale. Featuring layers of paint on unprimed linen or mulberry bark paper, Yun’s evocative works have been internationally celebrated following his death in 2007. In 2018, the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea, hosted a major retrospective of the artist’s work that traveled to the Palazzo Fortuny in Venice. Yun’s work is included in the museum collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chinati Foundation, the Glenstone, Tate Modern, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum.

Yun began to develop his visually stark, technically complex style in the early 1970s; he was particularly inspired by Mark Rothko’s color field paintings, which he saw on a 1974 trip to New York. He rose to prominence in Korea and represented his country at the 1995 Venice Biennale. Featuring layers of paint on unprimed linen or mulberry bark paper, Yun’s evocative works have been internationally celebrated following his death in 2007. In 2018, the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea, hosted a major retrospective of the artist’s work that traveled to the Palazzo Fortuny in Venice.

At a distance, many of her pieces evoke glistening mosaics, adobe walls, medieval chainmail, and baroque churches, dramatically reflecting the light that surrounds them. By using gold, Amaral invokes the material’s religious and ceremonial uses in pre-Columbian society—and its plunder by the Spanish and presence in colonial art.

At a distance, many of her pieces evoke glistening mosaics, adobe walls, medieval chainmail, and baroque churches, dramatically reflecting the light that surrounds them. By using gold, Amaral invokes the material’s religious and ceremonial uses in pre-Columbian society—and its plunder by the Spanish and presence in colonial art. Amaral studied architectural drafting in Colombia before completing graduate studies in fabric art at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. She has exhibited widely around the world and represented Colombia at the 1986 Venice Biennale. Her work has sold for six figures at auction and can be found in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the de Young Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Bogotá, among many others.

The natural and the manmade collide and coalesce both seamlessly and uncomfortably in his works. Panda illustrates the paradoxes inherent in India’s burgeoning development and prosperity and the profound destruction—of the environment, human beings, and traditional culture—caused by modernization. In his striking sculpture, The Cult of Survival II (2011), for example, Panda uses industrial plastic pipes to construct two giant, intertwined snakes in the act of devouring each other—a poignant commentary on the continual cycle of destruction, construction, and regeneration at play in modern-day India.

Trained initially as a poet, Eielson branched out  into the visual realm,  developing a unique style exemplified by his “Quipus” series—vibrant, textile-based artworks that drew inspiration from pre-Columbian cultures’ use of knots to keep records. After migrating to Italy in the 1950s, Eielson immersed himself in the European art scene.

Trained initially as a poet, Eielson branched out  into the visual realm,  developing a unique style exemplified by his “Quipus” series—vibrant, textile-based artworks that drew inspiration from pre-Columbian cultures’ use of knots to keep records. After migrating to Italy in the 1950s, Eielson immersed himself in the European art scene. His innovative use of fabric, especially in tension over canvas, created sculptural paintings that defied categorization. Eielson’s groundbreaking pieces were showcased at the Venice Biennale (1964, 1966, 1972, and 1988) and major galleries globally, with his works residing in prestigious collections such as the Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Though he experimented with other styles, he was a devoted follower of Fauvism. Dufy initially looked to the Impressionists for inspiration but was forever changed by his exposure to the vivid canvases of Paul Cézanne, André Derain, and Henri Matisse. He worked with watercolor, charcoal, oil, and acrylic, imbuing his scenes with liveliness as he painted his figures in rapid strokes atop thin washes of color. Dufy’s work was well received during his lifetime, and in 1952, he won the International Grand Prize for Painting at the Venice Biennale. Today his work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the Musée d’Orsay, among others, and a number of his paintings have sold for more than $1 million at auction.

Finelli-FeugèrePPPablo PicassoSpanish, 1881–1973FollowingFollowPerhaps the most influential artist of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso may be best known for pioneering Cubism and fracturing the two-dimensional picture plane in order to convey three-dimensional space. Inspired by African and Iberian art, he also contributed to the rise of Surrealism and Expressionism. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre grew to include over 20,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs. He painted his most famous work, Guernica (1937), in response to the Spanish Civil War; the totemic grisaille canvas remains a definitive work of anti-war art. At auction, a number of Picasso’s paintings have sold for more than $100 million. The indefatigable artist has been the subject of exhibitions at the world’s most prestigious institutions, from the Museum of Modern Art and Centre Pompidou to the Stedelijk Museum and Tate Modern.

Année érotique, Musée Picasso ParisView allGBGeorges BraqueFrench, 1882–1963FollowingFollowPainter, collagist, and sculptor Georges Braque co-founded Cubism with Pablo Picasso and revolutionized 20th-century painting. Throughout his oeuvre, which comprised mostly still lifes, Braque fractured the picture plane in order to explore a variety of viewpoints; he painted in muted tones, fragmenting and reconstructing tablescapes into energetic, geometric forms. Braque also made innovative collages: He helped develop the papier collé technique, pasting imitation wood-grain paper to his Cubist compositions. The artist originally trained as a decorator before turning to fine art. He embraced Impressionism and Fauvism, then solidified his signature Cubist style. After serving in World War I, Braque adopted vibrant color palettes and a freer, more naturalistic style. During his lifetime, the artist enjoyed retrospectives at the Louvre and Kunsthalle Basel. Today, his work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Centre Pompidou, among others. On the secondary market, a number of Braque’s pieces have sold for eight figures.

Throughout his oeuvre, which comprised mostly still lifes, Braque fractured the picture plane in order to explore a variety of viewpoints; he painted in muted tones, fragmenting and reconstructing tablescapes into energetic, geometric forms. Braque also made innovative collages: He helped develop the papier collé technique, pasting imitation wood-grain paper to his Cubist compositions. The artist originally trained as a decorator before turning to fine art. He embraced Impressionism and Fauvism, then solidified his signature Cubist style. After serving in World War I, Braque adopted vibrant color palettes and a freer, more naturalistic style. During his lifetime, the artist enjoyed retrospectives at the Louvre and Kunsthalle Basel. Today, his work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Centre Pompidou, among others. On the secondary market, a number of Braque’s pieces have sold for eight figures.

Though he experimented with other styles, he was a devoted follower of Fauvism. Dufy initially looked to the Impressionists for inspiration but was forever changed by his exposure to the vivid canvases of Paul Cézanne, André Derain, and Henri Matisse. He worked with watercolor, charcoal, oil, and acrylic, imbuing his scenes with liveliness as he painted his figures in rapid strokes atop thin washes of color. Dufy’s work was well received during his lifetime, and in 1952, he won the International Grand Prize for Painting at the Venice Biennale. Today his work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the Musée d’Orsay, among others, and a number of his paintings have sold for more than $1 million at auction.

Though he experimented with other styles, he was a devoted follower of Fauvism. Dufy initially looked to the Impressionists for inspiration but was forever changed by his exposure to the vivid canvases of Paul Cézanne, André Derain, and Henri Matisse. He worked with watercolor, charcoal, oil, and acrylic, imbuing his scenes with liveliness as he painted his figures in rapid strokes atop thin washes of color. Dufy’s work was well received during his lifetime, and in 1952, he won the International Grand Prize for Painting at the Venice Biennale. Today his work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the Musée d’Orsay, among others, and a number of his paintings have sold for more than $1 million at auction.

Certificate of authenticityIncludedFrameNot includedSeriesBasquiat Beat Bop Image rightsPhotos copyright Lot 180 LLC. JMJean-Michel BasquiatAmerican, 1960–1988FollowingFollowJean-Michel Basquiat’s dramatic life and iconic paintings—which variously feature obsessive scribbling, enigmatic symbols and diagrams, and iconography including skulls, masks, and the artist’s trademark crown—make him one of the most famous artists of the 20th century. The self-taught painter embraced graffiti before committing to a studio practice. He found a mentor and friend in Andy Warhol, who helped the young artist navigate the 1980s New York art world. Across his oeuvre, Basquiat drew on his own Caribbean heritage; a convergence of African American, African, and Aztec cultural histories; classical themes; and pop cultural figures including athletes and musicians. The immediacy and intellectual depth of his paintings won him widespread acclaim both before and after his untimely death at the age of 27. Basquiat’s paintings now belong in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others. In 2017, Basquiat’s Untitled (1982) notched $110.5 million at auction and became the most expensive artwork by an American artist to ever be sold.

His self-titled Gothic Futurism style was distinguished by the use of bright colors, barbed letters, and its symbolic campaign against standardization. Rammellzee’s self-given name is an esoteric derivation of a math equation. He first began tagging subway cars during the late 1970s. Rammellzee went on to release the hip-hop single “Beat Bop” with K-Rob in 1983, and exhibited alongside Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. In the decades that followed, the artist continued to produce experimental music, costume-like sculptures, and spray painted work. In 2004, Rammellzee collaborated with the design brand Supreme to create a release of 20 hand painted backpacks. The artist died on June 27, 2010 in New York, NY.

FrameNot includedJMJean-Michel BasquiatAmerican, 1960–1988FollowingFollowJean-Michel Basquiat’s dramatic life and iconic paintings—which variously feature obsessive scribbling, enigmatic symbols and diagrams, and iconography including skulls, masks, and the artist’s trademark crown—make him one of the most famous artists of the 20th century. The self-taught painter embraced graffiti before committing to a studio practice. He found a mentor and friend in Andy Warhol, who helped the young artist navigate the 1980s New York art world. Across his oeuvre, Basquiat drew on his own Caribbean heritage; a convergence of African American, African, and Aztec cultural histories; classical themes; and pop cultural figures including athletes and musicians. The immediacy and intellectual depth of his paintings won him widespread acclaim both before and after his untimely death at the age of 27. Basquiat’s paintings now belong in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others.

Rammellzee’s self-given name is an esoteric derivation of a math equation. He first began tagging subway cars during the late 1970s. Rammellzee went on to release the hip-hop single “Beat Bop” with K-Rob in 1983, and exhibited alongside Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. In the decades that followed, the artist continued to produce experimental music, costume-like sculptures, and spray painted work. In 2004, Rammellzee collaborated with the design brand Supreme to create a release of 20 hand painted backpacks. The artist died on June 27, 2010 in New York, NY.

FrameNot includedJMJean-Michel BasquiatAmerican, 1960–1988FollowingFollowJean-Michel Basquiat’s dramatic life and iconic paintings—which variously feature obsessive scribbling, enigmatic symbols and diagrams, and iconography including skulls, masks, and the artist’s trademark crown—make him one of the most famous artists of the 20th century. The self-taught painter embraced graffiti before committing to a studio practice. He found a mentor and friend in Andy Warhol, who helped the young artist navigate the 1980s New York art world. Across his oeuvre, Basquiat drew on his own Caribbean heritage; a convergence of African American, African, and Aztec cultural histories; classical themes; and pop cultural figures including athletes and musicians. The immediacy and intellectual depth of his paintings won him widespread acclaim both before and after his untimely death at the age of 27. Basquiat’s paintings now belong in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others. In 2017, Basquiat’s Untitled (1982) notched $110.5 million at auction and became the most expensive artwork by an American artist to ever be sold.

She is recognized as the first woman to achieve widespread acclaim in this traditionally male-dominated arena. Her career began in the vibrant streets of New York in 1999, coinciding with her studies at the Pratt Institute of Art. It was there that Curry developed her unique style using temporary paper portraits to adorn building façades with the aim of democratizing art and reclaiming public spaces within the urban landscape. Curry’s intricate wheatpaste portraits serve not only as art but also as a reflection of her personal connections with people who have deeply touched her life. She creates these pieces by carving wood or linoleum blocks, which are printed by hand, or by cutting through multiple layers of paper at once.

She is recognized as the first woman to achieve widespread acclaim in this traditionally male-dominated arena. Her career began in the vibrant streets of New York in 1999, coinciding with her studies at the Pratt Institute of Art. It was there that Curry developed her unique style using temporary paper portraits to adorn building façades with the aim of democratizing art and reclaiming public spaces within the urban landscape. Curry’s intricate wheatpaste portraits serve not only as art but also as a reflection of her personal connections with people who have deeply touched her life. She creates these pieces by carving wood or linoleum blocks, which are printed by hand, or by cutting through multiple layers of paper at once. Curry appeared in the Banksy film Exit Through the Gift Shop. Her work is the subject of an internationally touring museum exhibition, and a monograph about her work was published by the Italian publisher Drago.

Enhancing his mystique by maintaining an anonymous identity, the artist has modified street signs, illegally printed his own currency, and illicitly hung his own work in the Louvre and the Museum of Modern Art. He often uses spray paint and stencils in his critiques of consumerism, political authority, terrorism, and the status of art and its display. His street art, installations, and studio-produced works have been shown in Los Angeles, New York, London, Bethlehem, and beyond.

MaterialsOil on linenSize48 × 48 in | 121.9 × 121.9 cmRarityUniqueMediumPaintingImage rights© Cecily BrownCBCecily BrownBritish, b. 1969FollowingFollowPainter Cecily Brown works at the intersection of figuration and abstraction: She fills her monumental canvases with intimations of body parts and virtuosic, gestural brushstrokes that resolve more or less clearly into art history–inspired scenes. Brown draws on a range of compositional tenets including the formal planes of Neoclassicism, the vigor of Abstract Expressionists such as Willem de Kooning, and the haunting, fractured forms of Francis Bacon. Her paintings become intense, kaleidoscopic evocations of atmosphere and bodily experience. The artist studied at the Slade School of Art. She rose to prominence at the same time as the provocative Young British Artists, yet she kept her paintings decidedly separate from the movement. Brown’s powerful formalism won her fans around the world, and she has shown in cities including New York, London, Hong Kong, and Berlin. Her work belongs in the collections of the British Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, among others. Brown also maintains a celebrated drawing practice. Among the most expensive living female artists, her work has sold for seven figures on the secondary market.

Unframed.SignatureSigned and numbered to verso ‘Cecily Brown 8/25’.CBCecily BrownBritish, b. 1969FollowingFollowPainter Cecily Brown works at the intersection of figuration and abstraction: She fills her monumental canvases with intimations of body parts and virtuosic, gestural brushstrokes that resolve more or less clearly into art history–inspired scenes. Brown draws on a range of compositional tenets including the formal planes of Neoclassicism, the vigor of Abstract Expressionists such as Willem de Kooning, and the haunting, fractured forms of Francis Bacon. Her paintings become intense, kaleidoscopic evocations of atmosphere and bodily experience. The artist studied at the Slade School of Art. She rose to prominence at the same time as the provocative Young British Artists, yet she kept her paintings decidedly separate from the movement. Brown’s powerful formalism won her fans around the world, and she has shown in cities including New York, London, Hong Kong, and Berlin. Her work belongs in the collections of the British Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, among others. Brown also maintains a celebrated drawing practice. Among the most expensive living female artists, her work has sold for seven figures on the secondary market.

Brown draws on a range of compositional tenets including the formal planes of Neoclassicism, the vigor of Abstract Expressionists such as Willem de Kooning, and the haunting, fractured forms of Francis Bacon. Her paintings become intense, kaleidoscopic evocations of atmosphere and bodily experience. The artist studied at the Slade School of Art. She rose to prominence at the same time as the provocative Young British Artists, yet she kept her paintings decidedly separate from the movement. Brown’s powerful formalism won her fans around the world, and she has shown in cities including New York, London, Hong Kong, and Berlin. Her work belongs in the collections of the British Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, among others.

Across painting, murals, large-scale sculpture, and street art, as well as graphic and production design, his work possesses a sophisticated humor and thoughtful interplay with consumer products through collaborations with global brands. KAWS is often inspired by and appropriates pop culture animations to form a unique artistic vocabulary that spans a broad range of mediums. Now admired for his larger-than-life sculptures and hard-edge paintings that emphasize line and color, KAWS has created a cast of hybrid cartoon and human characters that are perhaps the strongest examples of his exploration of humanity. KAWS has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and internationally. Recent solo exhibitions of his work have been held at institutions such as the Brooklyn Museum; the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth; the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts; the Yuz Museum; Yorkshire Sculpture Park; and the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga. He has also participated in exhibitions at major institutions such as the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego; the Newcomb Art Museum; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and the Deste Art Foundation for Contemporary Art.

Across painting, murals, large-scale sculpture, and street art, as well as graphic and production design, his work possesses a sophisticated humor and thoughtful interplay with consumer products through collaborations with global brands. KAWS is often inspired by and appropriates pop culture animations to form a unique artistic vocabulary that spans a broad range of mediums. Now admired for his larger-than-life sculptures and hard-edge paintings that emphasize line and color, KAWS has created a cast of hybrid cartoon and human characters that are perhaps the strongest examples of his exploration of humanity. KAWS has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and internationally. Recent solo exhibitions of his work have been held at institutions such as the Brooklyn Museum; the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth; the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts; the Yuz Museum; Yorkshire Sculpture Park; and the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga. He has also participated in exhibitions at major institutions such as the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego; the Newcomb Art Museum; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and the Deste Art Foundation for Contemporary Art.

Across painting, murals, large-scale sculpture, and street art, as well as graphic and production design, his work possesses a sophisticated humor and thoughtful interplay with consumer products through collaborations with global brands. KAWS is often inspired by and appropriates pop culture animations to form a unique artistic vocabulary that spans a broad range of mediums. Now admired for his larger-than-life sculptures and hard-edge paintings that emphasize line and color, KAWS has created a cast of hybrid cartoon and human characters that are perhaps the strongest examples of his exploration of humanity. KAWS has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and internationally.

MaterialsExhibition posterSize24 × 36 1/5 in | 61 × 92 cmRarityUnknown editionMediumEphemera or MerchandiseEREd RuschaAmerican, b. 1937FollowingFollowEd Ruscha’s expansive oeuvre defies easy categorization, though it’s all infused with a kind of deadpan California cool. Since the 1960s, Ruscha has made photographic books, tongue-in-cheek photo collages, paintings, and drawings that demonstrate a keen interest in language and the idiosyncrasies of life in Los Angeles, where the artist has lived since the 1950s. In his most famous works, he places words and phrases from the colloquial and consumerist vernacular atop photographic images or fields of color—a strategy that situates him within a larger Pop art lineage. Ruscha often paints and draws with unusual materials such as gunpowder, blood, and Pepto Bismol, drawing attention to the deterioration of language and the pervasive clichés in American culture. Ruscha’s work has been exhibited across the globe, and the artist has enjoyed solo shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Moderna Museet, in addition to the Venice Biennale, where he represented the United States in 2005. At auction, his work has sold for eight figures.

Since the 1960s, Ruscha has made photographic books, tongue-in-cheek photo collages, paintings, and drawings that demonstrate a keen interest in language and the idiosyncrasies of life in Los Angeles, where the artist has lived since the 1950s. In his most famous works, he places words and phrases from the colloquial and consumerist vernacular atop photographic images or fields of color—a strategy that situates him within a larger Pop art lineage. Ruscha often paints and draws with unusual materials such as gunpowder, blood, and Pepto Bismol, drawing attention to the deterioration of language and the pervasive clichés in American culture. Ruscha’s work has been exhibited across the globe, and the artist has enjoyed solo shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Moderna Museet, in addition to the Venice Biennale, where he represented the United States in 2005. At auction, his work has sold for eight figures.

Since the 1960s, Ruscha has made photographic books, tongue-in-cheek photo collages, paintings, and drawings that demonstrate a keen interest in language and the idiosyncrasies of life in Los Angeles, where the artist has lived since the 1950s. In his most famous works, he places words and phrases from the colloquial and consumerist vernacular atop photographic images or fields of color—a strategy that situates him within a larger Pop art lineage. Ruscha often paints and draws with unusual materials such as gunpowder, blood, and Pepto Bismol, drawing attention to the deterioration of language and the pervasive clichés in American culture. Ruscha’s work has been exhibited across the globe, and the artist has enjoyed solo shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Moderna Museet, in addition to the Venice Biennale, where he represented the United States in 2005. At auction, his work has sold for eight figures.

She’s often inspired by her experiences growing up in apartheid-era South Africa; Dumas has based compositions on photographs of friends and family, mass-media imagery of current events and celebrities, and art historical references. Her ghostly palette comprises mostly grays, browns, blues, and pinks, and her style features blurred brushstrokes and thin washes of color. Nude bodies are a frequent motif—sometimes they’re engaged in amorous acts that highlight the figures’ expression, contact, and emotion. Dumas has enjoyed solo exhibitions at Moderna Museet, Tate Modern, the Stedelijk Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art, among other institutions. In 1995, she represented the Netherlands (her chosen home) at the Venice Biennale, and featured in the central pavilion in 2015. At auction, Dumas’s work has sold for seven-figure prices.

Her ghostly palette comprises mostly grays, browns, blues, and pinks, and her style features blurred brushstrokes and thin washes of color. Nude bodies are a frequent motif—sometimes they’re engaged in amorous acts that highlight the figures’ expression, contact, and emotion. Dumas has enjoyed solo exhibitions at Moderna Museet, Tate Modern, the Stedelijk Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art, among other institutions. In 1995, she represented the Netherlands (her chosen home) at the Venice Biennale, and featured in the central pavilion in 2015. At auction, Dumas’s work has sold for seven-figure prices.

She’s often inspired by her experiences growing up in apartheid-era South Africa; Dumas has based compositions on photographs of friends and family, mass-media imagery of current events and celebrities, and art historical references. Her ghostly palette comprises mostly grays, browns, blues, and pinks, and her style features blurred brushstrokes and thin washes of color. Nude bodies are a frequent motif—sometimes they’re engaged in amorous acts that highlight the figures’ expression, contact, and emotion. Dumas has enjoyed solo exhibitions at Moderna Museet, Tate Modern, the Stedelijk Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art, among other institutions. In 1995, she represented the Netherlands (her chosen home) at the Venice Biennale, and featured in the central pavilion in 2015. At auction, Dumas’s work has sold for seven-figure prices.

Mehretu uses her eclectic mix of styles to explore the history and politics of the urban environment; her source material has included architectural plans, city maps, and photographs, which she has transposed onto her massive canvases via projection. Mehretu graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design and has received the MacArthur Fellowship, the American Art Award granted by the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the U.S. Department of State Medal of Arts.

FrameNot includedJMJulie MehretuEthiopian-American, b. 1970FollowingFollowOn her large-scale canvases and murals, Julie Mehretu layers, erases, and relayers ink, pencil, and acrylic paint (sometimes sprayed or screen-printed) in a manner that conjures the dynamism of the Futurists, the scale and physicality of Abstract Expressionism, and the divergent mark-making of Albrecht Dürer, Eastern calligraphy, and graffiti. Mehretu uses her eclectic mix of styles to explore the history and politics of the urban environment; her source material has included architectural plans, city maps, and photographs, which she has transposed onto her massive canvases via projection. Mehretu graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design and has received the MacArthur Fellowship, the American Art Award granted by the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the U.S. Department of State Medal of Arts. She’s been the subject of solo shows at the Guggenheim Museum, the Walker Art Center, and the Whitney, among other institutions, and has been featured in international showcases including the 2019 Venice Biennale, Documenta 13 (2012), and the 2004 Whitney Biennial.

Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, he helped shepherd painting beyond Abstract Expressionism and towards Minimalism. Stella’s output has evolved from black-and-white striped paintings (which he created at the start of his career), to the irregularly shaped canvases of his bold 1970s “Polish Village” series, to the 3D-printed sculptures he produced in the 2010s. While the artist has a reputation for stylistic innovation, he views all of his works as part of a continuum. Stella cemented his place in art history in 1970 when, at age 33, he became the youngest artist to ever mount a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. He has since enjoyed major solo exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Kunstmuseum Basel, among other institutions, and his work belongs in public collections worldwide.

Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, he helped shepherd painting beyond Abstract Expressionism and towards Minimalism. Stella’s output has evolved from black-and-white striped paintings (which he created at the start of his career), to the irregularly shaped canvases of his bold 1970s “Polish Village” series, to the 3D-printed sculptures he produced in the 2010s. While the artist has a reputation for stylistic innovation, he views all of his works as part of a continuum. Stella cemented his place in art history in 1970 when, at age 33, he became the youngest artist to ever mount a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. He has since enjoyed major solo exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Kunstmuseum Basel, among other institutions, and his work belongs in public collections worldwide.

Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, he helped shepherd painting beyond Abstract Expressionism and towards Minimalism. Stella’s output has evolved from black-and-white striped paintings (which he created at the start of his career), to the irregularly shaped canvases of his bold 1970s “Polish Village” series, to the 3D-printed sculptures he produced in the 2010s. While the artist has a reputation for stylistic innovation, he views all of his works as part of a continuum. Stella cemented his place in art history in 1970 when, at age 33, he became the youngest artist to ever mount a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. He has since enjoyed major solo exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Kunstmuseum Basel, among other institutions, and his work belongs in public collections worldwide. His pieces regularly sell for seven figures at auction.

Common motifs across Murakami’s oeuvre—which spans paintings, sculptures, prints, and more—include smiling flowers, bears, and the Mickey Mouse–inspired character Mr. DOB. They also appear throughout Murakami’s thriving market for merchandise and collectibles. Murakami has presented at institutions including the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, MoMA PS1, Mori Art Museum, Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Brooklyn Museum, Museum für Moderne Kunst, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, among others, and his work has sold for millions on the secondary market. Murakami also runs a large influential art production and artist management company, the Tokyo-based Kaikai Kiki Co.

Common motifs across Murakami’s oeuvre—which spans paintings, sculptures, prints, and more—include smiling flowers, bears, and the Mickey Mouse–inspired character Mr. DOB. They also appear throughout Murakami’s thriving market for merchandise and collectibles. Murakami has presented at institutions including the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, MoMA PS1, Mori Art Museum, Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Brooklyn Museum, Museum für Moderne Kunst, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, among others, and his work has sold for millions on the secondary market. Murakami also runs a large influential art production and artist management company, the Tokyo-based Kaikai Kiki Co.

Her installations—which have taken the form of billboards, projections, park benches, condom wrappers, and electronic signs—feature texts which range from enigmatic, koan-like phrases such as “Abuse of power comes as no surprise” to longer, more involved screeds. Her iconic “Inflammatory Essays” (1979–82), for example, meditate on violence, vulnerability, and tensions between the individual and the collective. Holzer’s work has also targeted consumerism and the language of advertising. The artist received her MFA in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design and has since exhibited in cities around the world, including London, New York, Los Angeles, Zürich, Hong Kong, and Berlin. She has presented at institutions including the Guggenheim Museum, the Centre Pompidou, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Neue Nationalgalerie. In 1990, Holzer became the first living American woman to represent the United States at the Venice Biennale.

Unframed.SignatureHand-signed by artist, backFrameNot includedPublisherThe ArtistJHJenny HolzerAmerican, b. 1950FollowingFollowSince the 1970s, Jenny Holzer has inserted language into public settings as part of her singular conceptual practice. Her installations—which have taken the form of billboards, projections, park benches, condom wrappers, and electronic signs—feature texts which range from enigmatic, koan-like phrases such as “Abuse of power comes as no surprise” to longer, more involved screeds. Her iconic “Inflammatory Essays” (1979–82), for example, meditate on violence, vulnerability, and tensions between the individual and the collective. Holzer’s work has also targeted consumerism and the language of advertising. The artist received her MFA in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design and has since exhibited in cities around the world, including London, New York, Los Angeles, Zürich, Hong Kong, and Berlin. She has presented at institutions including the Guggenheim Museum, the Centre Pompidou, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Neue Nationalgalerie. In 1990, Holzer became the first living American woman to represent the United States at the Venice Biennale.

She has presented at institutions including the Guggenheim Museum, the Centre Pompidou, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Neue Nationalgalerie. In 1990, Holzer became the first living American woman to represent the United States at the Venice Biennale.

Throughout his compositions, the artist draws from art history, memory, and the people, objects, and interiors that compose the fabric of his life (the ceramics, in fact, reference the practice of Shio Kusaka, the artist to whom Wood is married; Kusaka draws from Wood’s work, as well). Inspired by artists including David Hockney and Alex Katz, Wood embraces bright palettes, detailed patterns, and flattened forms.

A fixture of New York’s East Village art scene in the 1980s, the largely self-taught artist often focused on the city’s blighted downtown landscape. He imbued row houses and ruins with a sense of magic as he considered the intersections of race, sexuality, and history in his urban environment.

A fixture of New York’s East Village art scene in the 1980s, the largely self-taught artist often focused on the city’s blighted downtown landscape. He imbued row houses and ruins with a sense of magic as he considered the intersections of race, sexuality, and history in his urban environment.

MaterialsAcrylic and pastel on linenSize11 × 13 in | 27.9 × 33 cmRarityUniqueMediumPaintingImage rightsCourtesy the artist, Karma, NY and Dowling WalshPerhaps the most influential artist of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso may be best known for pioneering Cubism and fracturing the two-dimensional picture plane in order to convey three-dimensional space. Inspired by African and Iberian art, he also contributed to the rise of Surrealism and Expressionism. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre grew to include over 20,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures,ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs. He painted his most famous work, Guernica (1937), in response to the Spanish Civil War; the totemic grisaille canvas remains a definitive work of anti-war art. At auction, a number of Picasso’s paintings have sold for more than $100 million. The indefatigable artist has been the subject of exhibitions at the world’s most prestigious institutions, from the Museum of Modern Art and Centre Pompidou to the Stedelijk Museum and Tate Modern.CMCenter for Maine Contemporary Art (CMCA) Benefit AuctionLot 2Reggie Burrows HodgesPace House (Self Portrait), 2021Acrylic and pastel on linen11 × 13 in | 27.9 × 33 cm Unique workBidding closedGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertCenter for Maine Contemporary Art: Benefit Auction 2021Other works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

In her performances, photographs, films, sculptures, and more, the artist explored the mystical and emotional connections between her body and the natural world. In her “Silueta” series (1973–80) of “earth-body” performances, for example, she lay directly on the earth and made silhouettes. Medieta then documented her imprint with paint, blood, or found materials such as twigs or flowers and photographed the results. Her works could be gruesome and haunting, and it’s tempting to read them as prophecies of her brutal, untimely death in 1985. Mendieta received her MFA from the University of Iowa’s intermedia program before moving to New York City, and she exhibited extensively there and in cities such as Havana, Miami, and Rome during her lifetime. Her practice has since been subject to revived interest, and her work has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1, Museo Jumex, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the New Museum, among other institutions.

In her performances, photographs, films, sculptures, and more, the artist explored the mystical and emotional connections between her body and the natural world. In her “Silueta” series (1973–80) of “earth-body” performances, for example, she lay directly on the earth and made silhouettes. Medieta then documented her imprint with paint, blood, or found materials such as twigs or flowers and photographed the results. Her works could be gruesome and haunting, and it’s tempting to read them as prophecies of her brutal, untimely death in 1985. Mendieta received her MFA from the University of Iowa’s intermedia program before moving to New York City, and she exhibited extensively there and in cities such as Havana, Miami, and Rome during her lifetime. Her practice has since been subject to revived interest, and her work has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1, Museo Jumex, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the New Museum, among other institutions.

In her performances, photographs, films, sculptures, and more, the artist explored the mystical and emotional connections between her body and the natural world. In her “Silueta” series (1973–80) of “earth-body” performances, for example, she lay directly on the earth and made silhouettes. Medieta then documented her imprint with paint, blood, or found materials such as twigs or flowers and photographed the results. Her works could be gruesome and haunting, and it’s tempting to read them as prophecies of her brutal, untimely death in 1985. Mendieta received her MFA from the University of Iowa’s intermedia program before moving to New York City, and she exhibited extensively there and in cities such as Havana, Miami, and Rome during her lifetime. Her practice has since been subject to revived interest, and her work has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1, Museo Jumex, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the New Museum, among other institutions.
