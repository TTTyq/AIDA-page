This lighting technique, reminiscent of the chiaroscuro method, creates a sultry effect throughout Franco Klein’s work exploring themes like consumption, leisure, emotional disconnection, media overstimulation, and the notion of eternal youth. Franco Klein began taking photos while studying architecture in Mexico City; she later received her MA in Photography from the University of the Arts London. The artist has received international acclaim throughout her career and her work has been exhibited in fairs including Photo Basel and Photo London.

The artist drew on a wide array of influences, ranging from the bold brushwork of Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline to Dada cut-ups and scientific illustration. His mark-making hovered between associative notation and romantic symbolism. Twombly’s works have been shown in cities across the world, and they belong to the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Centre Pompidou, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Guggenheim, among many others. His work has fetched prices in the tens of millions on the secondary market. In addition to his paintings, Twombly produced multimedia sculptures and collages and maintained a consistent photography practice.\nHigh auction recordUS$70.5m, Sotheby's, 2015Blue-chipRepresented by internationally recognized galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Centre Pompidou|Tate|Solomon R.

His paintings evince influences from his childhood in India, surrounded by vivid textiles, practicing rangoli, and witnessing the Holi Festival, and adulthood in New York in the 1960s and ’70s, in a milieu that included Andy Warhol, Merce Cunningham, and fellow Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko. To make his paintings, which range from intimate to grand, Bhavsar sifts powdered pigments onto canvas, allowing air currents and his own breath and body movements to determine where they fall, creating smoky, layered compositions. “I think I have tried to convey how to free oneself,” he describes. “Using color as a force to reach towards the beauty and generosity of the material that allows you unlimited expression.”\nCollected by a major museumWhitney Museum of American Art|The Metropolitan Museum of ArtSelected exhibitions2023Abstract Expressionist Works: Editions, Works on Paper and Paintings, Alpha 137 Gallery2018Elements of Color, HG Contemporary2017Phenomenon, HG ContemporaryView allDDAGNew Delhi, Mumbai, New York, DubaiFollowingFollowNatvar BhavsarVANARAA X, 1996Dry pigments with acrylic mediums on paper14 1/5 × 13 7/10 in | 36.1 × 34.8 cm Unique workPrice on requestContact GalleryBe covered by the Artsy Guarantee when you check out with ArtsyDAGNew Delhi, Mumbai, +2 moreGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

His paintings evince influences from his childhood in India, surrounded by vivid textiles, practicing rangoli, and witnessing the Holi Festival, and adulthood in New York in the 1960s and ’70s, in a milieu that included Andy Warhol, Merce Cunningham, and fellow Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko. To make his paintings, which range from intimate to grand, Bhavsar sifts powdered pigments onto canvas, allowing air currents and his own breath and body movements to determine where they fall, creating smoky, layered compositions. “I think I have tried to convey how to free oneself,” he describes. “Using color as a force to reach towards the beauty and generosity of the material that allows you unlimited expression.”\nCollected by a major museumWhitney Museum of American Art|The Metropolitan Museum of ArtSelected exhibitions2023Abstract Expressionist Works: Editions, Works on Paper and Paintings, Alpha 137 Gallery2018Elements of Color, HG Contemporary2017Phenomenon, HG ContemporaryView allAGAlpha 137 GalleryNew YorkFollowingFollowNatvar BhavsarUntitled mid 1960s abstraction, 1967Silkscreen on art paper7 × 7 in | 17.8 × 17.8 cmFrame includedEdition 10/30Part of a limited edition setIncludes a Certificate of AuthenticityUS$2,000PurchaseShipping and taxesBe covered by the Artsy Guarantee when you check out with ArtsyAlpha 137 GalleryNew YorkContact GalleryGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

To make his paintings, which range from intimate to grand, Bhavsar sifts powdered pigments onto canvas, allowing air currents and his own breath and body movements to determine where they fall, creating smoky, layered compositions. “I think I have tried to convey how to free oneself,” he describes. “Using color as a force to reach towards the beauty and generosity of the material that allows you unlimited expression.”\nCollected by a major museumWhitney Museum of American Art|The Metropolitan Museum of ArtSelected exhibitions2023Abstract Expressionist Works: Editions, Works on Paper and Paintings, Alpha 137 Gallery2018Elements of Color, HG Contemporary2017Phenomenon, HG ContemporaryView allCCChase ContemporaryPalm BeachFollowingFollowNatvar BhavsarAjanta Series V, 2014Pigment on paper37 × 27 1/2 in | 94 × 69.9 cm Unique workPrice on requestContact GalleryBe covered by the Artsy Guarantee when you check out with ArtsyChase ContemporaryPalm BeachGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

He briefly worked in a Cubist mode and helped spur movements including Dada and Conceptualism. Though his practice spanned drawing, painting, and installation, Duchamp is perhaps most famous for his “readymade” sculptures: pieces composed of prefabricated objects such as a urinal, a shovel, or a bicycle wheel affixed to a wooden stool, which the artist situated in the middle of the exhibition space. Duchamp saw the readymade as an opportunity to free art from traditional confines of taste and beauty. He studied at Académie Julian before becoming involved in the avant-garde circles of New York and Paris. Duchamp also played tournament chess and, in the last decades of his life, worked in secret on a final installation, Étant donnés (1946–66). His pieces have sold for up to eight figures on the secondary market and belong in the collections of countless institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, the Staatliches Museum Schwerin, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nHigh auction record€8.9m, Christie's, 2009Blue-chipRepresented by internationally recognized galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Centre Pompidou|Tate|Solomon R.

Dalí’s fantastical prints, paintings, sculptures, films, and writing helped cement the movement’s identity. Working off psychoanalytic ideas, Dalí rendered fantastical creatures and landscapes that could unsettle and awe. His 1931 canvas The Persistence of Memory is one of the most recognizable artworks of all time. Dalí exhibited widely in his lifetime, and his works belong in the collections of institutions including the Tate, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago, among others. His work has fetched multimillions of dollars on the secondary market.\nHigh auction record£13.5m, Sotheby's, 2011Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Centre Pompidou|Tate|Solomon R.

Born Emmanuel Radnitzky, the artist adopted his pseudonym in 1909 and—while he also worked across painting, sculpture, video, and printmaking—became renowned for his striking, sensual black-and-white photographs. A number of his portraits—such as Larmes (Tears) (ca. 1932), which features a woman “crying” glass bead tears, and his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse—are icons of 20th-century art. Man Ray also embraced technical experimentation; he used solarization and made Rayographs (an eponym for his photograms) as he pushed the boundaries of avant-garde photography. At auction, his work has sold for seven figures, and his paintings have fetched particularly high prices. Man Ray is represented in the collections of such institutions as the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nHigh auction recordUS$12.4m, Christie's, 2022Blue-chipRepresented by internationally recognized galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Centre Pompidou|Tate|Solomon R.

Inspired by African and Iberian art, he also contributed to the rise of Surrealism and Expressionism. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre grew to include over 20,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures,ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs. He painted his most famous work, Guernica (1937), in response to the Spanish Civil War; the totemic grisaille canvas remains a definitive work of anti-war art. At auction, a number of Picasso’s paintings have sold for more than $100 million.

These include Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks (1969, reworked 1974) in New Haven, Connecticut; Clothespin (1976) in Philadelphia; Shuttlecocks (1992) in Kansas City; and Cupid’s Span (2002), a gigantic archer’s bow in San Francisco. These pieces epitomize Oldenburg’s irreverent sense of humor and fascination with American consumerism, qualities which have also pervaded his performances, drawings, writings, and famous “soft sculptures”—cushiony, unserious objects that resemble diner foods and other symbols of Americana. Oldenburg’s work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Moderna Museet, and the Centre Pompidou.

These include Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks (1969, reworked 1974) in New Haven, Connecticut; Clothespin (1976) in Philadelphia; Shuttlecocks (1992) in Kansas City; and Cupid’s Span (2002), a gigantic archer’s bow in San Francisco. These pieces epitomize Oldenburg’s irreverent sense of humor and fascination with American consumerism, qualities which have also pervaded his performances, drawings, writings, and famous “soft sculptures”—cushiony, unserious objects that resemble diner foods and other symbols of Americana.

These include Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks (1969, reworked 1974) in New Haven, Connecticut; Clothespin (1976) in Philadelphia; Shuttlecocks (1992) in Kansas City; and Cupid’s Span (2002), a gigantic archer’s bow in San Francisco. These pieces epitomize Oldenburg’s irreverent sense of humor and fascination with American consumerism, qualities which have also pervaded his performances, drawings, writings, and famous “soft sculptures”—cushiony, unserious objects that resemble diner foods and other symbols of Americana. Oldenburg’s work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Moderna Museet, and the Centre Pompidou. At auction, many of his sculptures—including those of a clothespin, a depiction of a flexed muscle, french horns, a dress, a trowel, a sewing machine, and a typewriter eraser—have sold for more than $1 million.

These include Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks (1969, reworked 1974) in New Haven, Connecticut; Clothespin (1976) in Philadelphia; Shuttlecocks (1992) in Kansas City; and Cupid’s Span (2002), a gigantic archer’s bow in San Francisco. These pieces epitomize Oldenburg’s irreverent sense of humor and fascination with American consumerism, qualities which have also pervaded his performances, drawings, writings, and famous “soft sculptures”—cushiony, unserious objects that resemble diner foods and other symbols of Americana. Oldenburg’s work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Moderna Museet, and the Centre Pompidou. At auction, many of his sculptures—including those of a clothespin, a depiction of a flexed muscle, french horns, a dress, a trowel, a sewing machine, and a typewriter eraser—have sold for more than $1 million. Oldenburg often collaborated with his late wife, Coosje van Bruggen, who died in 2009.\nHigh auction recordUS$8.4m, Christie's, 2022Blue-chipRepresented by internationally recognized galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Centre Pompidou|Tate|Solomon R.

She emerged in the 1970s, a student of Robert Irwin’s. In her early works, she marked the California desert with colored pigment, mapping both the earthly and celestial terrain, a practice she has since brought to sites worldwide. Among her best-known projects is Sol Star (1996), for which she marked the desert south of the Great Pyramids of Giza with blue circles, each one associated with a star. Albuquerque’s work is centered upon scale, and our smallness in an infinite cosmos. “I was interested in that impossibility of vision,” she explains, “being able to perceive only what is around us, yet aware that […] what we are perceiving is only part of a much larger vision.”\nEstablishedRepresented by industry leading galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Whitney Museum of American Art|Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA)|Nasher Sculpture CenterSelected exhibitions202540th Anniversary Exhibition, Michael Kohn Gallery2024Lita Albuquerque \"Earth Skin\", Michael Kohn Gallery2023Groundswell: Women of Land Art, Nasher Sculpture CenterView allLALaguna Art Museum Benefit AuctionLot 201Lita AlbuquerqueSun and Moon Trajectories #5, 1995Lithograph with gold leaf applique22 × 30 in | 55.9 × 76.2 cmEdition of 60Bidding closedGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertLaguna Art Museum: 2020 California Cool Benefit Auction Other works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

Albuquerque’s work is centered upon scale, and our smallness in an infinite cosmos. “I was interested in that impossibility of vision,” she explains, “being able to perceive only what is around us, yet aware that […] what we are perceiving is only part of a much larger vision.”\nEstablishedRepresented by industry leading galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Whitney Museum of American Art|Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA)|Nasher Sculpture CenterSelected exhibitions202540th Anniversary Exhibition, Michael Kohn Gallery2024Lita Albuquerque \"Earth Skin\", Michael Kohn Gallery2023Groundswell: Women of Land Art, Nasher Sculpture CenterView allMMMark Moore Fine ArtOrangeFollowingFollowLita AlbuquerqueSedona Series, 1987Iridescent pigment and pastel on rag paper22 1/2 × 30 in | 57.2 × 76.2 cm Unique workShowing now • Jan 1–Dec 31Mark Moore Fine Art: Resale Works AvailableUS$4,500PurchaseMake an OfferShipping and taxesBe covered by the Artsy Guarantee when you check out with ArtsyMark Moore Fine ArtOrangeContact GalleryGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

She emerged in the 1970s, a student of Robert Irwin’s. In her early works, she marked the California desert with colored pigment, mapping both the earthly and celestial terrain, a practice she has since brought to sites worldwide. Among her best-known projects is Sol Star (1996), for which she marked the desert south of the Great Pyramids of Giza with blue circles, each one associated with a star. Albuquerque’s work is centered upon scale, and our smallness in an infinite cosmos. “I was interested in that impossibility of vision,” she explains, “being able to perceive only what is around us, yet aware that […] what we are perceiving is only part of a much larger vision.”\nEstablishedRepresented by industry leading galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Whitney Museum of American Art|Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA)|Nasher Sculpture CenterSelected exhibitions202540th Anniversary Exhibition, Michael Kohn Gallery2024Lita Albuquerque \"Earth Skin\", Michael Kohn Gallery2023Groundswell: Women of Land Art, Nasher Sculpture CenterView allMKMichael Kohn GalleryLos AngelesFollowingFollowLita AlbuquerqueSolar Pulse, 1975Oil on masonite48 × 48 in | 121.9 × 121.9 cmPrice on requestContact GalleryBe covered by the Artsy Guarantee when you check out with ArtsyMichael Kohn GalleryLos AngelesGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

Chicago’s practice spans painting, textile arts, sculpture, and installation and has explored the intricacies of childbirth (as seen in her “Birth Project” series, 1980–85), the possibilities of minimalist sculpture, and the relationship between landscape and the female body. Her most famous work, an installation called The Dinner Party (1974–79), is an homage to 39 influential female figures from Eastern and Western mythology and civilization. Chicago studied at the University of California, Los Angeles. She founded a groundbreaking and widely influential feminist art program while on staff at California State University, Fresno. Her work has been exhibited in New York, London, Milan, Chicago, and San Francisco and belongs in the collections of the British Museum, Moderna Museet, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Tate, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\nEstablishedRepresented by industry leading galleries.Collected by major museumsMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.|San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)|Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA)|Hammer Museum|Art Institute of Chicago|Nasher Sculpture Center|MCA Chicago|Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Serpentine GalleriesSelected exhibitions2018Judy Chicago: A Reckoning, ICA Miami2017Roots of “The Dinner Party”: History in the Making, Brooklyn Museum2014Chicago in L.A.: Judy Chicago's Early Work, 1963–74, Brooklyn MuseumView allJCJudy Chicago StudioFollowingFollowJudy ChicagoThe Dinner Party, 1979Mixed media576 × 504 × 36 in | 1463 × 1280.2 × 91.4 cmJudy Chicago StudioGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertMore From This Series View seriesJudy ChicagoRare Cloisonne Brooch, honoring Hildegarde of Bingen, from The Dinner Party, 1987 Alpha 137 GalleryUS$2,800 Judy ChicagoBigamy Hood Plate, 2020The End Gallery£450 Judy ChicagoSigning the Dinner Party, 2009Turner Carroll GalleryUS$7,200 Judy ChicagoThe Dinner Party, 1996The End Gallery£550 Judy ChicagoMadame De Stael Dessert Plate, 2020Alpha 137 GalleryUS$775 Judy Chicago“And then all that divided them merged” Banner Design for THE DINNER PARTY, 1978Reeves Art + DesignUS$7,500 Judy ChicagoSigning the Dinner Party, 2009David Richard GallerySold Judy ChicagoThe Dinner Party (five plates), 2018PhillipsBidding closed Judy ChicagoThe Dinner Party, 1979Brooklyn Museum of Art Judy ChicagoVirginia Woolf (preparatory drawing for The Dinner Party), 1976National Museum of Women in the Arts Judy ChicagoThe Dinner Party, 1979Brooklyn Museum Judy ChicagoHrosvitha Test Plate, 1979Jessica SilvermanSold Judy ChicagoJudy Chicago and Others Working in “The Dinner Party” Needlework Loft, 1978Brooklyn Museum Judy ChicagoElizabeth Blackwell Test Plate, 1975–78\"Surveying Judy Chicago: Five Decades\" at The Palmer Museum of Art, Jan. 21 - May 11, 2014 Judy ChicagoVirginia Woolf (test plate for The Dinner Party), 1978National Museum of Women in the Arts Judy ChicagoTender Buttons: Tearful Flight/Trying/So Flight/Missing, 1975National Museum of Women in the Arts Judy ChicagoStudy for C.

The style and concerns of her early works placed them in dialogue with those of the Minimalists; though diverging from the Minimalists in her exploration of three-dimensional space in painting, rather than flat surfaces, her images of diffuse light on wooden ground and rulers lying on a linoleum floor occupy a space between representation and abstraction. From the early 1980s, Mangold began to paint sensitive landscape images that she sometimes framed by what appears to be masking tape adhered to the picture plane, but upon closer inspection is Mangold’s illusionistic painting of tape. She also focused her eye on individual trees, returning to the same subjects repeatedly for decades—tightly cropped compositions of individual elm, maple, locust, and pink oak trees depicted from unusual vantage points. \nEstablishedRepresented by industry leading galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Whitney Museum of American Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art|National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.|Louisiana Museum of Art|Art Institute of ChicagoSelected exhibitions2025Not Just A Pretty Picture, Rhona Hoffman Gallery2021Sylvia Plimack Mangold: The Pin Oak, 1985-2015, Krakow Witkin Gallery2016Drawing Dialogues: Selections from the  Sol LeWitt Collection, Drawing CenterView allHAHeritage AuctionsLot 66039Sylvia Plimack MangoldNovember 1978, 1978Oil on canvas30 × 40 in | 76.2 × 101.6 cmBidding closedGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertHeritage Auctions: Modern & Contemporary Art (November 2016)Other works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

She also focused her eye on individual trees, returning to the same subjects repeatedly for decades—tightly cropped compositions of individual elm, maple, locust, and pink oak trees depicted from unusual vantage points. \nEstablishedRepresented by industry leading galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Whitney Museum of American Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art|National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.|Louisiana Museum of Art|Art Institute of ChicagoSelected exhibitions2025Not Just A Pretty Picture, Rhona Hoffman Gallery2021Sylvia Plimack Mangold: The Pin Oak, 1985-2015, Krakow Witkin Gallery2016Drawing Dialogues: Selections from the  Sol LeWitt Collection, Drawing CenterView allKWKrakow Witkin GalleryBostonFollowingFollowSylvia Plimack MangoldAquatint, Sugarlift and Golden Changes, 1977Portfolio of 3 etchings and aquatints in color11 × 12 in | 27.9 × 30.5 cmEdition of 50Part of a limited edition setPrice on requestContact GalleryBe covered by the Artsy Guarantee when you check out with ArtsyKrakow Witkin GalleryBoston Get notifications for similar worksCreate AlertOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

Along with Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, Davis was at the center of the Washington, D.C. contingent of Color Field painters known as the Washington Color School.

Early in his career, he made thick, heavily impastoed abstractions, yet it was his later atmospheric, layered spray-paint canvases that brought him fame. Olitski exhibited widely during his lifetime, and in 1969, he became the first living artist and the third artist ever to have a solo show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

His works often feature shaped canvases, bold blocks of color, and simple patterns of chevrons, stripes, and bull’s-eyes. Noland pushed American abstract painting beyond the boundaries of Abstract Expressionism—instead of focusing on gestures and energetic lines, he conducted more conceptual experiments with color, form, and pared-back compositions that espoused flatness and a minimalist sensibility. Noland’s work has been exhibited in New York, Paris, Los Angeles, London, Tokyo, Berlin, and Zürich and belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art.

Throughout the post-war period, he made radical shifts away from the dominant forms and disciplines of his day. For example, Caro eliminated plinths from his practice and placed his sculptures directly on the floor. He constructed his large-scale pieces from materials such as rope, wood, lead, and—most famously—rusted steel. On occasion, he used found objects including buoys, chains, and railroad ties. Caro’s work often blurred the lines between architecture and art. The artist was enormously influential, and his work has been exhibited at institutions including Tate Britain, the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Seoul Museum of Art, the National Gallery in London, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. Caro’s sculptures have fetched seven figures on the secondary market.\nBlue-chipRepresented by internationally recognized galleries.Collected by a major museumMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)|Centre Pompidou|The Metropolitan Museum of Art|Leeum - Samsung Museum of Art|National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.|Louisiana Museum of Art|Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA)|Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona (MACBA)|Museo Reina Sofia|Nasher Sculpture CenterSelected exhibitions2023Caro and Music, Annely Juda Fine Art2022Anthony Caro - More real, more felt, Templon2019Anthony Caro: Seven Decades, Annely Juda Fine ArtView allKenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Anthony CaroCARO, NOLAND & OLITSKI (Hand signed by Anthony Caro and Jules Olitski), 1994Offset lithograph poster (hand signed by Julies Olitski and Anthony Caro)38 × 26 in | 96.5 × 66 cmEdition of 500 (Uniquely hand signed by Caro and Olitski) Part of a limited edition setIncludes a Certificate of AuthenticityUS$2,800PurchaseShipping and taxesBe covered by the Artsy Guarantee when you check out with ArtsyAlpha 137 GalleryNew YorkContact GalleryGet notifications for similar worksCreate AlertArtist Series Portraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availablePortraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availablePortraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availablePortraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availablePortraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availablePortraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availablePortraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availablePortraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availablePortraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availablePortraits of Artists and Sculptors113 availableOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceOther works by Pablo PicassoView AllArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceArtist NameArtwork TitlePartnerPriceRelated artistsGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowGeorges BraqueFrench 1900-2000FollowMeet your new art advisor.Discover ArtsyAbout usAboutJobsPressContactResourcesOpen SourceBlogThe Art Genome ProjectPartnershipsArtsy for GalleriesArtsy for MuseumsArtsy for BenefitsArtsy for FairsSupportVisit our Help CenterBuying on ArtsyGet the AppiOS AppAndroid App© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationTheme© 2025 ArtsyTerms and ConditionsAuction SupplementBuyer GuaranteePrivacy PolicySecurityDo not sell my personal informationThemeCookie ConsentWe use cookies to improve your experience and personalize marketing.

Prior to joining the Gutai, Uemae had studied Nan Ga—the southern school of Chinese painting—and western movements, but believes his most formative experience was an apprenticeship in Kyozome, or the Kyoto style of dyeing. Because of this training, as well as a childhood immersed in non-figurative design, the practice of sewing became paramount to Uemae’s mature style. His mixed-media paintings sometimes feature textile elements, but are characteristically identified by his careful compositions comprised of fine dots or patterns.
